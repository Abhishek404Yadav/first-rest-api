# first-rest-api
##Implemented a RESTful API with the following endpoints:
##### (1) GET /tasks: Retrieve all tasks.
##### (2) GET /tasks/:id Retrieve a single task by its ID.
##### (3) POST /tasks: Create a new task.
##### (4) PUT /tasks/:id Update an existing task by its ID.
##### (5) DELETE /tasks/:id Delete a task by its ID.
## Additional details to be noted
#### 1) Used an in-memory data store (e.g., an array) to store the tasks.
#### 2) Implement proper error handling for invalid requests.
#### 3) Tested the API using Postman to ensure it works as expected.
